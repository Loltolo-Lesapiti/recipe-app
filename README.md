## About the Project

The Recipe App keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking, the app allows you to make them public so anyone can access them.
